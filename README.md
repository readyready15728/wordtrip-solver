# Wordtrip Solver
## Solver for a crappy game that came with my new phone

Given a set of letters as an argument, `solver.py` will run through all the
permutations of length 2 to the length of the input and check whether each
permutation is in the dictionary and print those out, which will enable me to
blaze through this game.
